 This QGIS plugin, designed for use in introductory GIS courses, contains a Group By tool and a Direction and Distance tool, as well as installation of a set of Mapbox Maki icons and National Park Service (NPS) icons.

 The Group By and Distance and Direction algorithms were written by Maja Cannavo and Joseph Holler, and the plugin was built by Maja Cannavo using [Plugin Builder](https://github.com/g-sherman/Qgis-Plugin-Builder).
 The Maki icons were downloaded [here](https://labs.mapbox.com/maki-icons/) from Mapbox, and the NPS icons were downloaded [here](https://www.nps.gov/carto/app/#!/maps/symbols) from NPS. Both sets of icons were then edited by Joe Holler to allow for color customization in QGIS.

Group By tool ([help](insert link here)):
Group features with common values in the group field(s). Optionally, dissolve geometries and calculate summary statistics (average, count values, sum, maximum, minimum) for numeric fields.

Direction and Distance tool([help](insert link here)):
Calculates the distance and direction from an origin to a set of  input features.
